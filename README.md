Exciting News!
I'm thrilled to announce the completion of my latest project - an Inquirer Calculator built with TypeScript!
Throughout this project, I've honed my skills in TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and other features to the language, making code more robust and easier to maintain. I owe a huge thanks to my incredible teacher, Sir Naeem, whose guidance and expertise have been instrumental in my learning journey. His channel, NaeemCodeHub, provided invaluable resources and tutorials on TypeScript, empowering me to tackle this project with confidence.
Huge thanks to my amazing teacher, Sir Naeem from NaeemCodeHub, for teaching me TypeScript and guiding me through this project.
ðŸ’¡ Features in my inquirer calculator include basic arithmetic operations, error handling, and extensibility for future enhancements.
